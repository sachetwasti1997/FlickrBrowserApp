/*Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading
in your applicationâ€”often in one line of code!
Picasso download the image in another thread and it manages for you:
    ->the placeholder in the meantime the image is still downloading
    ->resizing
    ->cropping/centering/scaling
    ->caching ( you don't have to download the image every time)
    ->it even does "image fade in", which is popular/normal now
